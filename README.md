# DirectX-3D-Game
At present, I have to create an application that makes use of the Directx11 API and make something creative. This is my attempt at that. 

Made in C++

The outcome of this project was a creative, fun game that featured HeightMaps, a cyborg shooting zombies, as well as other easter eggs (or collectables). Definitely a highlight of my academic pursuits.
